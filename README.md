# PRIDE-New-Benchmark-Dataset-For-Protein-Structural-Design

## About this Repo

This repo is open-source for all protein design learners for providing the benchmark of the paper PRIDE: [A benchmark for structure-guided protein design evaluation]. All constructed dataset described in the paper as well as the corresponding scripts are here. Welcome all peotein structural design researchers!

## 1. Benchmark Datasets
    We design our benchmark to based on two fundamental principles about generative protein design
    models: The capacity and sequence diversity of our benchmark should meet the training and testing
    needs of deep learning models; No data leak or sequence redundancy between training and test set.
