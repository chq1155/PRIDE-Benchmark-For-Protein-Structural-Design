# PRIDE-New-Benchmark-Dataset-For-Protein-Structural-Design

## About this Repo

This repo is open-source for all protein design learners for providing the benchmark of the paper PRIDE: [A benchmark for structure-guided protein design evaluation]. All constructed dataset described in the paper as well as the corresponding scripts are here. Welcome all peotein structural design researchers!

## 1. Benchmark Datasets

We design our benchmark to based on two fundamental principles about generative protein design models: The capacity and sequence diversity of our benchmark should meet the training and testing needs of deep learning models; No data leak or sequence redundancy between training and test set.

### 1.1 Training Dataset

Our training dataset is made up of the CATH dataset. CATH S35 V4.3. consists of 32389 proteins ranges up to date 21-Oct-2010. 

### 1.2 Test Dataset

Here, we utilized CAMEO as an independent test set to test existing modelsâ€™ performance. Users can directly run the script we provide to update the test set to evaluate the performance of the models. Our chosen proteins dataset ranges in CAMEO from 17-07-2021 to 12-03-2022 and consists of 504 proteins. We selected the hard samples and guaranteed no redundancy exists between the training set.

### 1.3 Data Manipulation Process

Users can use our provided scripts to create their own dataset for flexibility.
